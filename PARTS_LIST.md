Parts List
=====================================
- Arduino UNO model R3
- Dremel model 7700, 7.2V MultiPro

- Briefcase
- Acrylic casing
- Protoboard for motor circuit
- Breadboard for potentiometer, push button, display circuits
- Copper wire
- Jumper wire
- Solder
- "Gorilla Glue" Epoxy, for gluing acrylic
- Hot glue
 
- [] Hitachi LCD
- [] LED Push Button, for changing operating modes
- 2x potentiometers
  - 1 [] for setting time and speed
  - 1 [] for adjusting LCD contrast

- Transistor [2N6388]
  - for controlling motor speed
  - operates in "Active-Region Safe Operating Area"
  - operates safely below absolute maximum ratings for continuous and peak collector current, and for collector-emitter voltage
- 330 Ohm resistor
  - limits maximum current at base of transistor (current that is supplied by pin 10) to levels safe for the Arduino
- 0.1 uF (bypass/filter/decoupling) capacitor, ceramic [NTE CML104M50]
  - 1 to denoise the potentiometer
- 1000 uF capacitor [Fry's brand]
  - from the motor's power supply to the emitter
  - prevents noise generated by motor's inductance from getting to other parts of the circuit
  - dampens noise (fluctuating voltage/current) experienced by the motor
  - helps smoothen the voltage spikes from turning the motor on and off

- Diode [1N5408]
  - prevents motor's back-EMF (created on motor shutdown) from reaching and damaging other parts of circuit
  - handles twice the maximum motor current
  - handles reverse-bias breakdown voltages higher than the motor's back-EMF voltage
  - has an ideal low maximum forward voltage (low voltage drop across diode)
