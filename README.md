This was a project under De Anza's Engineering and Technology Club (ETC) from Fall 2015 to Winter 2016, inspired by [orlov127's Instructable, "Arduino and Dremel Powered Centrifuge"](http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-and-Dremel-Powered-Centrifuge/).

Original project members, without whom I would be pushing code on the streets alone: Albert Ju and Fu Yang Chin
