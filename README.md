Dremelfuge
========================================
A cheap Dremel-centrifuge!
<br>
<br>

## Agenda
- Install Dremel motor and its power supply
- Insert diode
- Solder all capacitors:
  - to prevent motor noise to from producing LCD garbage
  - to turn motor buzzing into motor spinning
  - to eliminate noise affecting potentiometer
  - solder according to: https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J15/9
- Cut and hot-glue everything into case

========================================
### To Buy:
- Acrylic glue (acrylic cement) [from Sears]
- Soldering board
- 5x 0.1 uF (bypass/filter/decoupling) capacitor, ceramic [NTE CML104M50]
  - 1 to denoise the potentiometer
  - 3 to absorb noise created by the motor, so it does not interfere with the LCD
    - https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J15/9
  - 1 to absorb potential noise across the LCD
- 2x 1000 uF capacitors [Fry's brand]
  - 1 cap **across the motor's power supply (parallel to the motor, one end at Vcc and the other end at the emitter of the transistor)**
    - stabalizes the PWM square wave (PWM voltage/time graph) through capacitor discharge, which supplies electrons during down voltage, so the motor runs continuously (not being pulsed on then off rapidly) with a current still proportional to the PWM output - basically a cheap A/C converter called an RC circuit
    - reduces noise experienced by the motor
    - prevents noise generated by motor's inductance from getting to other parts of the circuit
    - helps smoothen the voltage spikes from turning the motor on and off
    - http://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/267/why-are-capacitors-added-to-motors-in-parallel-what-is-their-purpose
  - 1 cap to absorb potential large voltage spikes near the LCD, about to enter it (due to the motor, to catch what the above capacitors might not)
- 1x 1uF capacitor, just in case
- 1x 10uF capacitor, just in case
- 1x 100uF capacitor, just in case  
- ~~Diode [1N5822]~~
  - rated to handle twice the max load current AND twice the negative of the max load voltage (lower than breakdown voltage), preventing the motor's back-EMF from destroying other components
  - must also have a maximum forward voltage low enough so that small load currents can make it past the diode, for when the smallest controlling currents are supplied at base

#### Notes:
- No resistor needed--NTE24 transistor strong enough to accept raw PWM at base, (5*(x/255)) Volts
- Choosing appropriate diodes and capacitors is simple and straightforward--only a few parameters matter
  - Diodes
    - Forward voltage (V_F) - the maximum Volts at which the diode will be an "on" state and act like an open circuit (like it's not even there)
    - Maximum reverse voltage (V_RRM) - the maximum negative voltage that the diode can handle
  - Capacitors
    - Capacitance (C)
    - Rated DC voltage (V_R)

### Odd behaviors:
- Motor does not turn on again if it's toggled TOO QUICKLY (such that the motor is actually spinning, rather than just humming)
  - => back EMF not filtered well, motor circuit needs time to dissipate energy after a toggle?
  - => idkkkkkkk
- Motor humming but not spinning && motor won't start without a push
  - => capacitor linearizes the PWM square wave (turns PWM into an actually constant voltage) => constant current => no disconnected "spurts of torque"

- Garbage on LCD
  - => bypass/filter/decoupling capacitor across the LCD, AND ANOTHER across the motor

- Noise on potentiometer
  - => bypass/filter/decoupling cap
